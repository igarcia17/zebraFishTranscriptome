Zebra fish is a handy model to work with in the study of regenrative molecular biology. Unfortunately, there is no common tools for the visualization of its gene expression freely available. For this reason, the objective of this project is to creaate a friendly web interface that plots the differences in gene expression in different tissue samples and developmental stages.

The data used in publicly available in GEO and ENA. The accession ID of the samples in SRA can be consulted on data/sra_samples.
