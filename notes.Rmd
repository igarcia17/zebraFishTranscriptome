data:

- how to work -> summarizeExperiment object

- normalization: cpm + log (add pseudocount)

input:

- features meta: ensembl ID, gene name, GO

###how to do the GO

- samples meta: sample ID, tissue, dev stage, condition, replicate, experiment

#### improvement: allow user to upload the data, and transform it properly into a summarizedExperiment

- check box for table

- tab heatmap: select what samples to show; default, show all

- tab bar graph: take average from similar samples, merge by tissue and by developmental stage


output:

- heat map by sample

- bar graph by type of sample -> plot is okay

- table with raw counts
